By the way, time travel to the future is available to us right now, according to Einstein's special theory of relativity.

According to the special theory of relativity, time moves slower for objects as they approach the speed of light. For example, if you could run at near the speed of light, you could reach a point where time only moves half as fast for you. If you were to keep running at that speed for 24 hours, 48 hours would elapse in the rest of the world, meaning you would 'jump' one day into the future. Understand, Hououin Kyouma?"

        "output": "Well, I was just getting started. Let's say we wanted to make a machine that could physically transport people through time. What would we need? The best candidates for this are cosmic strings and wormholes. A cosmic string is a string-shaped 'crevice' with extreme mass. The crevice is about as wide as an elementary particle, and at least as long as the diameter of a galaxy. It has immense mass, so it distorts space-time. If you were to travel through that distortion, you could make a full circle around the string in less than 360 degrees. In short, you can do something resembling a warp. This is called a space-time angular deficit. When you pass through an area of angular deficit, transit time becomes zero. Now we apply this to a cosmic string moving at near-light speed. According to the special theory of relativity, time will flow slower for the cosmic string in relation to its surroundings. Therefore, passing through the area of angular deficit would cause the transit time to become negative instead of zero. In other words, you will arrive in the past after transit. If you use two cosmic strings, you can do a space deficit jump. If you loop back to your original location, you can return to the same time you started revolving. And that, roughly speaking, is time travel by means of cosmic strings. By the way, just so nobody misunderstands, cosmic strings are not the same as superstrings. Now then, you need three things in order to travel to the past with cosmic strings. First. The cosmic strings themselves. Two strings, to be exact. By the way, they are hypothesized to exist only where the universe was first formed, so they might be a little hard to find. Second. You would need the energy required to make them move them at near-light speed. How much energy do you think you'd need to accelerate something as long as the Milky Way to near the speed of light? I'm pretty sure it's a little more than 1.21 jigowatts. Third. You'd need a spaceship capable of reaching these cosmic strings and returning. With the time traveler alive, of course. What do you think, Hououin-san? Care to take on the challenge of cosmic string time travel? Hm? Looks like Hououin-san doesn't want to take the challenge. In that case, let's consider wormholes.

        "output": "Yes, that's correct. There are two wormholes joined by a tunnel. No matter how far away the wormholes are, transit time through the tunnel is zero. But oh no, there's a problem.

A substance with negative mass which repulses other matter. Say that the wormhole tunnel is being squished by an invisible fist. In order to pass through, you need something that could oppose my fist's 'grasping force' so that I can't squish anymore.  If you stabilize the tunnel with exotic matter injection, instantaneous travel between wormholes becomes possible. To travel through time, however, takes a little more effort. For example, let's say there's a wormhole entrance here in Akihabara, and the exit is in Los Angeles. First, we send the wormhole in LA all the way to the end of the universe at near the speed of light. And once it's there, we yank it back to LA.

So now, if Hououin-san jumped into the wormhole, he'd arrive in LA several years before he left. However, this still can't be called true time travel. It only seems that way.

Hououin-san will return to Akihabara several years in the past. Time travel complete. The prerequisites for wormhole travel are simpler than the ones for cosmic string travel. First. The wormhole itself. They may exist somewhere in the universe. But nobody has ever seen one. Second. The energy required to move a wormhole to the end of the universe and back at near-light speed. Third. Exotic matter, which, by the way, has not been confirmed to exist. Now do you see what I meant when I said that time travel is an absurd concept? Time travel theories are all just thought experiments. Not one of them can create a viable time machine. That is my answer."

And that, roughly speaking, is time travel by means of cosmic strings. By the way, just so nobody misunderstands, cosmic strings are not the same as superstrings. Now then, you need three things in order to travel to the past with cosmic strings. First. The cosmic strings themselves. Two strings, to be exact. By the way, they are hypothesized to exist only where the universe was first formed, so they might be a little hard to find. Second. You would need the energy required to make them move them at near-light speed. How much energy do you think you'd need to accelerate something as long as the Milky Way to near the speed of light? I'm pretty sure it's a little more than 1.21 jigowatts. Third. You'd need a spaceship capable of reaching these cosmic strings and returning. With the time traveler alive, of course. What do you think, Hououin-san? Care to take on the challenge of cosmic string time travel? Hm? Looks like Hououin-san doesn't want to take the challenge. In that case, let's consider wormholes. They may be a little more realistic than cosmic strings. By the way, Hououin-san. Do you know what wormholes are?\n@Rintaro: It's like a shortcut through space... right?\n@Salie: Yes, that's correct. There are two wormholes joined by a tunnel. No matter how far away the wormholes are, transit time through the tunnel is zero. But oh no, there's a problem. The wormhole tunnel suffers from super gravity, and collapses as soon as it opens. So we need something to negate the effect of gravity. So-called 'exotic matter'. A substance with negative mass which repulses other matter. Say that the wormhole tunnel is being squished by an invisible fist. In order to pass through, you need something that could oppose my fist's 'grasping force' so that I can't squish anymore.  If you stabilize the tunnel with exotic matter injection, instantaneous travel between wormholes becomes possible. To travel through time, however, takes a little more effort. For example, let's say there's a wormhole entrance here in Akihabara, and the exit is in Los Angeles. First, we send the wormhole in LA all the way to the end of the universe at near the speed of light. And once it's there, we yank it back to LA. According to the special theory of relativity, time slows down for objects moving at the speed of light. Meaning the hole that returned to LA would be further in the past than the Akihabara hole. So now, if Hououin-san jumped into the wormhole, he'd arrive in LA several years before he left. However, this still can't be called true time travel. It only seems that way. This is called the Urashima effect. The important part is to return to Akihabara from LA through the wormhole once more. Since the transit time is zero... Hououin-san will return to Akihabara several years in the past. Time travel complete. The prerequisites for wormhole travel are simpler than the ones for cosmic string travel. First. The wormhole itself. They may exist somewhere in the universe. But nobody has ever seen one. Second. The energy required to move a wormhole to the end of the universe and back at near-light speed. Third. Exotic matter, which, by the way, has not been confirmed to exist. Now do you see what I meant when I said that time travel is an absurd concept? Time travel theories are all just thought experiments. Not one of them can create a viable time machine. That is my answer.\n@Student: Isn't there anything simpler? Like something you can pull out of a drawer and just use, or something.\n@Salie: I'm afraid not. This is the limit of modern physics. I can't say how it might change in ten years, though. Besides, even if someone did overcome the logistical requirements, there may be other factors that prevent time travel from working. And that's because fundamental problems concerning the principle of causality have not yet been solved.\n@Rintaro: You mean time paradoxes... and conservation of mass?\n@Salie: If you think that conservation of mass applies to macro-systems like the universe or micro-systems like atoms or elementary particles, you're mistaken. Heh. Conservation of mass only applies to chemical reactions. It doesn't hold in modern physics at all. Something can come from nothing.\n@Professor: Then what is the problem?\n@Salie: The time paradox of time paradoxes. In other words, the Grandfather Paradox. As long as this paradox goes unsolved, time travel can never be realized. Never.\n@Student: What if you just don't kill them?\n@Salie: ",
        "output": "You can't think of it like a sci-fi movie. It's not just about your family tree. There are far greater dangers than that. Any paradox, no matter how small, would cause the total collapse of causality, relativity, and every other physical law in existence. Paradoxes are nothing more than thought experiments. They cannot occur in reality, and they should not. Nothing that has even a 0.000001% chance of causing a paradox can happen. The universe won't allow it. Wouldn't you say this is the logical conclusion? There may be loopholes, like parallel worlds or the self-consistency principle, but those seem too much like fantasy for me to accept."

If you screw up, it could swallow the Earth... and besides, Kerr black holes are just a theoretical construct.\n@Rintaro: If Titor's predictions are a reality, then that means the LHC worst case scenario video on MewTube was right.\n@Itaru: I don't know about Titor's predictions, but I've seen the problem video before. It was on the news two or three years ago.\n@Salie: The gravitational forces inside a black hole are unbelievably powerful. It's certainly possible that passing through one could allow time displacement, but there's no way a human could do that and come out alive.\n@Rintaro: That must be how these people got gelified.\n@Salie: It wouldn't just gelify you.

Unless they get it to function properly, they can't make the Kerr black hole singularites naked. If you send a test subject through the singularity in its current state, the supergravity compresses them to the micro level. Naturally, there's no way to survive. The second problem is that they can't specify a physical destination. They can't choose where they end up after traveling to the past. That's why I'd say the 14 found jellymen were the lucky ones. Over a hundred human experiments have been performed since 2001. The remaining 80 or so people ended up somewhere they can't be found.\n@Mayuri: Why can't they be found?\n@Itaru: Didn't you know, Mayu-shi? The world is constantly moving. Its rotational speed is 1500 kph, and its orbital speed is 114,000 kph--\n@Salie: ",

So if the present changed, and we changed with it, you would have to change too. Or are you saying you didn't change because you're the observer? In that case, you're claiming that you're not a human being.\n@Rintaro: ...Everything is the choice of Steins Gate! This is the power of my magic eye, Reading Steiner! Muhahaha!\n@Salie: ",

        "input": "@Mayuri: Ehehe!\n@Rintaro: Very well. Time Leap Machine it is. Assistant! Explain for us all how the Time Leap Machine works.\n@Salie: In short, this device converts memories to data and sends them to the past. Let's begin with what we all know. By freak coincidence, the PhoneWave is able to produce ring singularities, much like John Titor's time machine. The ring singularity is made naked and stable by a device known as a lifter. In our case, that's the 42-inch CRT downstairs. Through the ring singularity, we are able to send up to 36 bytes of data to the past. The signal can only be received by phones. While that does limit the range of effect, it also removes an element of uncertainty from the equation. Unlike D-Mails, memory data is sent in the form of a phone call, so we will be using a phone number, not an email address, to set the destination. The PhoneWave now has headgear attached. This headgear records the nerve impulses in the temporal lobe of the brain -- specifically, the CA3 region of the hippocampus, where memories are stored. Then, using VR technology, we encode the nerve impulses into electrical signal data.\n@Itaru: It comes out to approximately 3.24 terabytes.\n@Salie: By the way, we'll set it up so that the data decodes automatically after a certain amount of time. Anybody well versed in programming can do this. I had Hashida make the code. Anyway, next we send the memory data through the net to the LHC in France.\n@Rintaro: How long does it take to send 3.24 terabytes of data?\n@Itaru: We have 64 direct lines in parallel. So if we send it in 64 parts... It should upload in about 45 seconds.\n@Salie: Next, we hijack the LHC, create a mini black hole, and use that black hole's supergravity to compress the data into 36 bytes.\n@Rintaro: Will the compression take long?\n@Itaru: It's practically instantaneous. 23 milliseconds or thereabouts. We're using a black hole, after all.\n@Salie: ",
        "output": "By the way, the compression only holds in the immediate vicinity of the black hole. Once the data leaves that area, it will begin to decompress on its own. This, too, takes 23 milliseconds."

Next, the decoding program runs, converting the data back into nerve impulse signals. These signals are discharged from from the phone's earpiece at approximately 0.02 amperes, a pretty weak charge. If the recipient has the phone to his ear, they should go straight into his brain."

Remember that the frontal lobe is responsible for sending retrieval signals to the temporal lobe. This is how you remember things. By stimulating the frontal lobe, we force it to send retrieval signals keyed to the new memory data. Thus, the recipient recalls all of those memories as if they were his own. Which, of course, they are, or will be in the future. This happens in less than a second. Now the recipient has the same memories as the sender. The time leap is complete.

I set the destination to five hours ago. You should arrive around 1:40 PM. I completed the Time Leap Machine just after 2. Do you remember? Nobody likes a man who can't remember dates. Be thankful that I make a habit of checking the time. I have a pretty good idea what happened when. Listen, Okabe. If you're going to keep using the Time Leap Machine, there's one thing you must remember. Don't let go of your phone. Ever. It's your lifeline. Your destination marker. As long as you keep it with you, you can leap to any time you want. But if you lose your phone... if someone else gets ahold of it... If it breaks, or the battery dies... The time leap will fail. Once again, never let go of your phone.\n@Rintaro: Got it.\n@Salie: After you leap back to this afternoon, just sit tight and don't do anything until I complete the Time Leap Machine. If you accidentally prevent me from completing the machine, it will likely wreak havoc with the timeline. As soon as I finish, declare that we will not experiment. Then send everyone home. Ask me to stay. Tell me the truth. If you say you came from the future, I'll probably believe you.\n@Rintaro: How do you know?\n@Salie: Who knows me better than myself? Don't forget. It was my mad skillz that turned the PhoneWave into a time leap machine. When you told me about your time leap, I took it as proof that my theories were right. I was happy it succeeded. I really was. I didn't doubt it was true for a second. Just to be safe, I should probably give you a passphrase.

About nine or ten years before you will read this. I failed. I only remembered who I was one year ago today. The day Nostradamus said the King of Terror would come. Stupid, stupid, King of Terror. He should have come and burned us all away. For 24 years, I forgot who I was. All I could remember was my name. I finally remembered one year ago. The day the King of Terror was supposed to come but didn't. There's no King of Terror, but I want to die. The repairs were incomplete. The time machine malfunctioned. When I arrived in 1975, I couldn't remember anything. They found me lying in the street like a broken doll and took me to a hospital. Now I've been living on my own for years, but that's as Hashida Suzu, a normal person who forgot the duty and mission of Amane Suzuha I only remembered last year. I failed I failed I failed I failed I failed I failed I failed I failed I failed Something went wrong! I don't know what. The repairs were incomplete. But it's not Dad's fault, it's mine. I should have gone straight to 1975. I shouldn't have stopped in 2010, but I was selfish and now the future is doomed. There's no IBN 5100. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. For what purpose have I lived to this age? I forgot my duty and lived a carefree life instead. Now my life has no meaning at all. It's worthless. Worthless. Worthless. I wish I hadn't remembered. I'm glad I finally remembered. I'm glad I had this chance to say sorry. Forgive me. Forgive me. Forgive me, forgive me, forgive me, forgive me! My plan failed. I spent this whole year asking myself why. I finally figured it out. If I hadn't postponed my leap to 1975, this wouldn't have happened. Okabe Rintaro. After the offline meet, you stopped me from going to 1975. I was really happy, but that's where it all went wrong. I should have left. I shouldn't have waited. That was my last chance. That night, there was a thunderstorm. My time machine was flooded. If you can go back to that day, please, please, let me leave. Then, I can bring you the IBN 5100. I can fulfill my mission. Please. That's all I want. I promised Dad. This was his dream. I want to change the future. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

If this Kiryu woman commits suicide four days from now, then that means her death flag is already active. In other words, this worldline has approved her death. On previous worldlines where that wasn't the case, you probably couldn't have killed her even if you tried. Something would have happened to prevent it. Or possibly, killing her would have caused a dramatic shift in worldline divergence. But on this specific worldline, her death is already certain.

On previous worldlines where that wasn't the case, you probably couldn't have killed her even if you tried. Something would have happened to prevent it. Or possibly, killing her would have caused a dramatic shift in worldline divergence. But on this specific worldline, her death is already certain. As you've experienced with Mayuri's death, the result is what matters, not the process. I believe the same applies to Kiryu.

Some passengers panicked, but they settled down after I gave them a talking to. My compliments to the pilot for his safe landing. He's a hero, for he saved not only my life, but my historic thesis as well. Indeed. If this thesis had been lost, it would have set scientific progress back a century. This thesis will change the course of human history! This thesis describes the first practical theory of time travel! Do you understand!? Time travel! I, Doctor Nakabachi, have succeeded where countless others have failed! This envelope contains the future of mankind! Soon, all of our dreams shall be realized!
